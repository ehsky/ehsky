## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Erlend 

### About me
I work with Salesforce as an architect and developer.  
I focus on **reusable architecture** and **security by design**.  
I have delivered **two apps to the Salesforce AppExchange**.  
Iâ€™m also a **home automation enthusiast**, with an open-source app for the **Homey Pro hub**.

### Project highlights
- Developer of the **eMabler Connector** AppExchange app.  
- Maintainer of **Signicat Sign** for Salesforce at Stretch Engage.  
- Developer of the **Xcomfort Bridge Connector** app for Homey Pro (home automation).

### How I work
- Keep solutions simple and maintainable.  
- Reuse patterns and frameworks where it makes sense.  
- Always think about security as part of the design, not as an afterthought.  

### What drives me
- Making teams faster by removing unnecessary complexity.  
- Building tools and frameworks that others actually want to use.  
- Sharing knowledge in a way that is practical and easy to apply.  

### Always learning
I spend time exploring:  
- Patterns that make architecture more consistent across projects.  
- How to balance flexibility and control in packaged solutions.  

### Contact
Iâ€™m open to feedback, ideas, or collaboration.
